This is my first post on this little platform that I've built.

I will probably detail its inner workings in a future article. Suffice to say
it's the very opposite of refined, and if I hesitate to call it ugly, it is
only because I made it simple enough that I don't hate it.

There are several reasons for me to have made this. The most prominent one of
course is as a mean of procrastination. Another reason would be the great
dislike that I have developed towards the modern internet. For most people,
what would be called as a “web presence”, is usually attained through the ever
famous _colossi_ of the web. While information technologies are becoming
increasingly available and omni-present in everyday life, net-citizens are less
the “home-owners” than they used to be. In many ways we have become like digital
cattle. It is not immediately apparent how we are paying for the spaces that we
rent, but we are paying nonetheless, were it be with our privacy, security, or
even sanity...

Lastly, as I started to get sucked into the tech world, I have noticed a bunch
of personal websites, more or less minimal, that I enjoy reading regularly.
I keep many of them in my list of feeds, and even if those, as a general rule,
are vastly more interesting than what'll write, I told myself that I'd try
doing something similar.
