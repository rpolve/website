## About me

I like computing, particularly the Unix family and its derivatives. My other
main interest is Biology, which has to do with my formal education.

## About this site

Scripts and resources available at [this
repo](https://github.com/rpolve/website). The color scheme is loosely based on
[Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme.

## Personal resume
