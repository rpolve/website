<p>I guess this is the inaugural content for this platform.</p>
<p>I will probably detail its inner workings in a future article. Suffice to say it’s the very opposite of refined, and if I hesitate to call it ugly, it is only because I made it simple enough so that I don’t outright hate it.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for me to have made this. The most prominent one, and the reason I do most things, is as a mean of procrastination. Another reason would be the great dislike that I have developed towards a certain portion of the modern internet. While information technologies are becoming increasingly available and omnipresent in everyday life, net-citizens are worryingly less the “home-owners” than they used to be. In many ways we have become like digital cattle. It may not be immediately apparent how we are paying for these platforms, but we are paying nonetheless, be it with our privacy, security, or our attention…</p>
<p>Lastly, as I started to get sucked into the tech world, I have noticed a bunch of personal websites, more or less minimal, that I enjoy reading regularly. I keep many of them in my list of feeds, and even if those, as a general rule, are vastly more interesting than what I could imagine myself writing, I thought I’d try doing something similar.</p>
